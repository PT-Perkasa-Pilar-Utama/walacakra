- Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
- Always run "npx tsc --noEmit" and fix the type error
- Follows the principle: "Tell a story with your code" - each function/components is a chapter, and the main function/component tells the complete story in just a few lines
- Minimize the comment unless it is necessary
